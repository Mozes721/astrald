## Status

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of astral - a general-purpose peer-to-peer network. Like most PoCs,
this code is hightly experimental and will break and crash and might not work for you at all. At this stage
I publish this for developers to get early feedback on the ideas expressed by the code.
