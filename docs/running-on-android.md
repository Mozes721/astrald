# Running on Android

Native Android app is under development, but you can easily run `astrald`
using Termux
([F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/),
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)).

You might need to download the latest Go version for ARM (or whatever your
phone is running) from https://go.dev/dl/ . I also recommend running `astrald`
inside a `tmux` session and disabling power optimizations for Termux.
